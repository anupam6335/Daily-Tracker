   ## Code Example
   ```python
   def binary_search(arr, target):
       left, right = 0, len(arr)-1
       while left <= right:
           mid = (left + right) // 2
           # ... solution continues
   ```
   ```

3. **🏷️ Add Smart Metadata**
   - **Tags**: `binary-search, algorithms, python, beginners`
   - **Visibility**: Public 🌍 or Private 🔒
   - **Auto-slug**: URL-friendly title conversion

4. **✅ Publish & Share**
   - Instant availability at `/blogs/your-blog-slug`
   - Automatic view counting
   - Like system for community feedback

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

### 🔄 **Real-time Sync Architecture**

```javascript
// Intelligent Conflict Resolution
class SyncEngine {
  async syncData() {
    // 1. Check for conflicts
    if (serverVersion > localVersion) {
      // 2. Smart merge instead of overwrite
      const merged = this.mergeIntelligently(serverData, localData);
      // 3. Preserve user's recent changes
      return this.preserveRecentCompletions(merged);
    }
    // 4. Push updates with version control
    await this.pushWithConflictDetection();
  }
}
```

**Sync Features:**
- ⚡ **Debounced Saving**: Prevents API spam during rapid typing
- 🔄 **Background Sync**: Every 20 seconds automatically
- 💾 **Offline Support**: Full functionality without internet
- 🛡️ **Conflict Resolution**: Never lose your progress

### 🎨 **User Experience Magic**

**Progressive Enhancement:**
```css
/* Smooth theme transitions */
:root {
  --bg-color: #0d1117;
  --text-color: #c9d1d9;
  --accent-color: #58a6ff;
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

/* Mobile-first responsive design */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .main-container { flex-direction: column; }
  .heatmap-grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(26, 10px); }
}
```
